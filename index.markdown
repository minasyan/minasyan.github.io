I am a third year PhD student in the [Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu) department at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu) where I am fortunate to be advised by [Elad Hazan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ehazan/). 

My research interest is in machine learning theory and algorithms, more specifically areas such as *online learning*, *reinforcement learning and control*, *learning and games*. I am also interested in large scale *convex and nonconvex optimization*.

Prior to joining Princeton, I did my undergrad at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu) majoring in both math (18) and computer science (6-3). My earlier life was based in Yerevan, Armenia mainly competing in contests like IMO and IOI.
